## What's included

- Utility scripts for specific functions
- Clean dependency installation scripts
- Development and container management tools

## Usage

```powershell
# From the project root directory
cd Building-Energy-Management-Tool-BEMAT
.\bemat.ps1
```

This gives you all the options you need in a unified interface!
